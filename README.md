> ABOUT THE GAME
>> “IT IS BETTER TO FIGHT AND FALL THAN TO LIVE WITHOUT HOPE.”
THE SAGA OF THE VOLSUNGS, C.12.
Northgard is a strategy game based on Norse mythology in which you control a clan of Vikings vying for the control of a mysterious newfound continent.
After years of tireless explorations, brave Vikings have discovered a new land filled with mystery, danger and riches: Northgard. The boldest Northmen have set sail to explore and conquer these new shores, bring fame to their Clan and write history through conquest, trading, or devotion to the Gods.
That is, if they can survive the dire Wolves and Undead Warriors roaming the land, befriend or defeat the giants, and survive the harshest winters ever witnessed in the North...


> CHOOSE YOUR CLAN
>> In order to complete the 11 campaign chapters, the player will have to master the specificities of the 6 first clans and tame the unforgiving wilderness of Northgard. Since the beginning of Northgard's colonization, several new clans have joined the battle, introducing new ways of playing and battling.
